    <h1>My three favourite things!</h1>
    <hr />
    <li>My first favourite thing is playing and watching basketball!</li>
    <p>
      Basketball is my favourite sport no doubt. I enjoy playing it with my
      friedns. I also like watching basketball, watching the pro players play
      and taking their moves and improving my moves.

    <li>My second favourite thing is being outside!</li>
    <p>
      I love being outside and breathing the fresh air. I also love being
      outside with my friends because we can have a lot of fun and do a lot of
      activities. When ever I'm feeling stressed or nervous I can go outside and
      calm myself down.

    <li>My third favourite thing is eating and making food!</li>
    <p>
      I love eating food and tasting all those different flavours on my tounge.
      I also like making food and try new things with food, and also making
      combonations and making new foods.
